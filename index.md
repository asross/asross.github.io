<p>
Hello! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at NYU Courant as part of the <a href='https://m2lines.github.io'>M<sup>2</sup>LInES</a> initiative, where I research how to improve ocean and climate models with interpretable machine learning techniques.
</p>

<p> Previously, I did a PhD in Computer Science with <a href='https://finale.seas.harvard.edu' target='_blank'>Finale Doshi-Velez</a> at <a href='https://www.seas.harvard.edu'>Harvard SEAS</a>, developed software at <a href='https://www.vermonster.com' target='_blank'>Vermonster</a>, and studied Physics at <a href='https://www.haverford.edu'>Haverford</a>.
