<p>
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University advised by <a href='https://finale.seas.harvard.edu' target='_blank'>Finale Doshi-Velez</a>. My research is about how to make machine learning models more compatible with human conceptual models, so they can be used safely and as a tool to help us understand the world.</p>

<p>Before my PhD, I spent several years as a software developer at <a href='https://www.vermonster.com' target='_blank'>Vermonster</a>, where I worked on a variety of projects including clinical decision support tools for oncology and building management data visualization. Before that, I studied Physics at Haverford College.</p>
