<p>
Hello! I'm currently a software engineer at Arcadia, where I focus on optimizing battery dispatch schedules based on electricity tariffs, household consumption profiles, and rooftop solar/battery hardware specs.
</p>

<p> Previously, I did a postdoc on machine learning for climate modeling at NYU Courant as part of <a href='https://m2lines.github.io'>M<sup>2</sup>LInES</a>, did a PhD researching interpretable ML with <a href='https://finale.seas.harvard.edu' target='_blank'>Finale Doshi-Velez</a> at <a href='https://www.seas.harvard.edu'>Harvard SEAS</a>, and developed software at <a href='https://www.vermonster.com' target='_blank'>Vermonster</a>.
